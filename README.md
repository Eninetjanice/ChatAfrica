# Chat Africa
This repository contains our end of foundations project called **ChatAfrica** which is a web-based chatbot application that allows one to know more about the African culture and its diversity. The application uses GPT-3 to generate responses and renders it to the user in text format. Other resources used to train the data are found in the folder named [content](https://github.com/devmarrie/ChatAfrica/tree/master/content).
